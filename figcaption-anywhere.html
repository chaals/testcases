<h1>Testing <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code></h1>

<p>This page is in development and will probably change over the next few days.</p>

<p>Please provide results explaining what happens in the various cases, either as <a href="https://github.com/chaals/testcases/">pull requests in github</a>, by email to chaals@yandex-team.ru, or as comments on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/html/issues/177">HTML issue 177</a>.</p>

<p>The HTML 5 specification states that a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element"><code>figure</code> element may have zero or one <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> children</a>, which must be the first or last child of a figure element.</p>

<p>This page provides some tests to determine whether there is any reason to make the restriction on either number or placement of <code>figcaption</code> children of a <code>figure</code> element, based on interoperability requirements.</p>

<section>
<h2>Results</h2>

<p><strong>Rough, obviously</strong>. All results on Mac OS 10.10.5 using VoiceOver. Safari 9.1 seems not to implement figure at all. Yandex 16.3 and Firefox 45 both report the figure, respectively as a figure and a group. They include text alternatives for individual images, and all <code>figcaption</code> elements found as children anywhere in the <code>figure</code>, as the text alternative for the figure.</p>
</section>
<section>

 <h2>"Null case" example</h2>
 <p>In this case there is a paragraph of text, a second paragraph containing three images that won't load, one with <code>alt="one"</code>, one with a null <code>alt</code> value <code>""</code>, and one without an <code>alt</code> attribute, and a third paragraph containing three valid images with the same <code>alt</code> values.</p>
 <div class="example">
  <p>A null case example</p>
  <p><img src="borken" alt="one"><img src="borken" alt=""><img src="borken"></p>
  <p><img src="shapes.png" alt="one"><img src="shapes.png" alt=""><img src="shapes.png"></p>
 </div>

 <p>This is to determine how a given browser "normally" treats the images, when they are not part of a <code>figure</code>, for comparison with the figure examples.</p>

 <h2>Currently conformant <code>figure</code>: <code>figcaption</code> as the first child</h2>
 <p>A  <code>figure</code> has a <code>figcaption</code> as the first child, a second paragraph containing three images that won't load, one with <code>alt="one"</code>, one with a null <code>alt</code> value <code>""</code>, and one without an <code>alt</code> attribute, then a third paragraph containing three valid images with the same <code>alt</code> values.</p>

 <div class="example">
  <figure>
   <figcaption>A compliant example</figcaption>
   <p><img src="borken" alt="one"><img src="borken" alt=""><img src="borken"></p>
   <p><img src="shapes.png" alt="one"><img src="shapes.png" alt=""><img src="shapes.png"></p>
  </figure>
 </div>

 <p>Browsers should give "a compliant example" as the textual alternative for the figure.</p>

 <h2>Another currently conformant <code>figure</code>: <code>figcaption</code> as the last child</h2>
 <p>A  <code>figure</code> has a paragraph containing three images that won't load, one with <code>alt="one"</code>, one with a null <code>alt</code> value <code>""</code>, and one without an <code>alt</code> attribute, a second paragraph containing three valid images with the same <code>alt</code> values, and a <code>figcaption</code> as the last child.</p>

 <div class="example">
  <figure>
   <p><img src="borken" alt="one"> <img src="borken" alt=""> <img src="borken"></p>
   <p><img src="shapes.png" alt="one"> <img src="shapes.png" alt=""> <img src="shapes.png"></p>
   <figcaption>Another compliant example</figcaption>
  </figure>
 </div>

 <p>Browsers should provide "Another compliant example" as the textual alternative for the entire <code>figure</code>.</p>

 <h2>A <code>figcaption</code> between two images</h2>

 <p>This example is invalid markup according to HTML5</p>

 <p>A  <code>figure</code> has a paragraph containing three images that won't load, one with <code>alt="one"</code>, one with a null <code>alt</code> value <code>""</code>, and one without an <code>alt</code> attribute, a <code>figcaption</code> as the middle child element, then a third paragraph containing three valid images with the same <code>alt</code> values as before.</p>

 <div class="example">
  <figure>
   <p><img src="borken" alt="one"> <img src="borken" alt=""> <img src="borken"></p>
   <figcaption>A rebellious example</figcaption>
   <p><img src="shapes.png" alt="one"><img src="shapes.png" alt=""><img src="shapes.png"></p>
  </figure>
 </div>

 <p>Browsers should provide "A rebellious example" as an alternative for the figure, but code checkers should report an error</p>

 <h2>Test case for <code>figcaption</code> between two images</h2>

 <p>This example is invalid markup according to HTML5</p>

 <p>A <code>figure</code> has a paragraph containing three images that won't load, one with <code>alt="one"</code>, one with a null <code>alt</code> value <code>""</code>, and one without an <code>alt</code> attribute, then a <code>figcaption</code> containing the text "A more rebellious example" as the second child, a <code>figcaption</code> containing the text "Increased lack of respect" as the third child, and finally a second paragraph containing three valid images, with the same set of <code>alt</code> values as before.</p>

 <div class="example">
  <figure>
   <p><img src="borken" alt="one"> <img src="borken" alt=""> <img src="borken"></p>
   <figcaption>A more rebellious example</figcaption>
   <figcaption>Increased lack of respect</figcaption>
   <p><img src="shapes.png" alt="one"><img src="shapes.png" alt=""><img src="shapes.png"></p>
  </figure>
 </div>

 <p>Browsers should provide "A rebellious example" - without recognising the second <code>figcaption</code> as an alternative for the figure, but code checkers should report an error because the <code>figcaption</code>s are not first or last, and because there are two of them.</p>

 <h2>Two <code>figcaption</code> elements, first and last as per HTML 5</h2>

 <p>This example is invalid markup according to HTML5</p>

 <p>A <code>figure</code> has  a <code>figcaption</code> containing the text "This could be great", a paragraph containing three images that won't load, one with <code>alt="one"</code>, one with a null <code>alt</code> value <code>""</code>, and one without an <code>alt</code> attribute, as the second child, a second paragraph containing three valid images, with the same set of <code>alt</code> values as before as the third child, and finally a <code>figcaption</code> containing the text "Right place, wrong time".</p>

 <div class="example">
  <figure>
   <figcaption>This should be great</figcaption>
   <p><img src="borken" alt="one"> <img src="borken" alt=""> <img src="borken"></p>
   <p><img src="shapes.png" alt="one"><img src="shapes.png" alt=""><img src="shapes.png"></p>
   <figcaption>Right place, wrong time</figcaption>
  </figure>
 </div>

 <p>Browsers should provide "This should be great" - without recognising the second <code>figcaption</code> as an alternative for the figure. Code checkers should report an error because there are two <code>figcaption</code>s.</p>
