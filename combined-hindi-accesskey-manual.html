 <h1>multiple unicode points as accesskey test</h1>

 <p>This tests using something like <code>accesskey="श्र"</code> as an <code>accesskey</code> that is a single printable character, and can be generated with a single keystroke, but that is more than one unicode code point.</p>

<p>The test is apparently run using an "INSCRIPT" Hindi keyboard, which has the relevant keys available as shift. If you cannot activate or focus any links, then (probably) the <code>accesskey</code> attribute is ineffective and the results are not helpful. If you can activate the first, then </code>accesskey</code> works with a single printable character that is multiple unicode code point, the HTML 5.2 spec as of 5.2 doesn't match reality and we should make a change, as per <a href="http://github.com/w3c/html/issues/485">issue 485</a>. The third test is for curiosity, since I don't understand Hindi enough yet to know what to expect here.</p>

<p>The following link uses <code>accesskey="श्र"</code>. Can you use <a href="test.html" accesskey="श्र">accesskey श्र</a> to focus or activate it?</p>
