  <title>Area with alt and no href manual test: what happens</title>
 </head>
 <body>
 <h1><code>&lt;area&gt;</code> with <code>alt</code> not <code>href</code> test</h1>

 <p>This tests what happens when an <code>&lt;area&gt;</code> element doesn't have a text alternative. Is there a way to discover it, and the fact that it is not linked?</p>

 <p>It should be possible to identify a red square, and a hole as part of the following paragraph. According to the specification there should be a link to green.html, followed by a link to "green circle".</p>

 <p>Please select a shape: <img src="shapes.png" usemap="#shapes"
   alt="Four shapes: a red hollow box, a green circle, a blue triangle,
   and a yellow four-pointed star.">
  <map name="shapes">
    <area shape=circle coords="200,75,10" href="green.html">
    <area shape=circle coords="200,75,30">
    <area shape=circle coords="200,75,50" alt="Green circle." href="green.html">
    <area shape=rect coords="50,50,100,100" alt="a hole"> <!-- the hole in the red box -->
    <area shape=rect coords="25,25,125,125" href="red.html" alt="Red box.">
    <area shape=poly coords="325,25,262,125,388,125" href="blue.html" alt="Blue triangle.">
    <area shape=poly coords="450,25,435,60,400,75,435,90,450,125,465,90,500,75,465,60"
        href="yellow.html" title="Yellow star.">
  </map>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The current <a href="https://w3c.github.io/html/semantics-embedded-content.html#embedded-content-image-maps">HTML 5.1 specification for image maps</a> mandates in its <a href="https://w3c.github.io/html/semantics-embedded-content.html#image-maps-processing-model">processing model</a> that:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>area</code>s are assigned space on the image in DOM order, so an <code>area</code> cannot "claim" a space already declared as part of an earlier <code>area</code> in the map</dt>
  <dd>This seems to work commonly</dd>
  <dt><code>area</code>s whose <code>href</code> duplicates that of an <code>area</code> already declared are not presented to the user as a text link</dt>
  <dd>This doesn't seem to happen</dd>
  <dt><code>area</code>s with no <code>href</code> are not presented to a user as a text link</dt>
  <dd>This seems to be patchy</dd>
</dl>
