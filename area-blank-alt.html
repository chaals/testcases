 <h1><code>area</code> with <code>alt</code></h1>

 <p>The following image uses an imagemap that contains 5 <code>area</code> elements. The first has no href, and is used to provide an outline shape, the others have respectively a valid <code>alt</code> attribute; blank <code>alt</code> attribute; valid <code>alt</code> attribute and a descriptive <code>title</code> attribute; missing <code>alt</code> attribute.</p>

 <p> <img src="shapes.png" usemap="#theMap" alt="Four shapes each link to one of two different places">
  <map name="theMap">
  <area shape=rect coords="50,50,100,100"> <!-- the hole in the red box -->
  <area shape=rect coords="25,25,125,125" href="one.html" alt="One">
  <area shape=circle coords="200,75,50" href="two.html" alt="">
  <area shape=poly coords="325,25,262,125,388,125" href="two.html" alt="Two" title="link to two">
  <area shape=poly coords="450,25,435,60,400,75,435,90,450,125,465,90,500,75,465,60"
        href="one.html">
  </map></p> 
  <p>To pass, the user must be able to determine the target of each link</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>On Mac OS 10.10, using VoiceOver</h3>
<p>Yandex.browser 16.2 (chromium-based), Safari 9.03 and Firefox 44 all fail to match the links with blank alt to those with valid alt, and instead VoiceOver presents the target of the link. In the case of the missing <code>alt</code> attribute with Firefox Voiceover presents the absolute URL of the link - in all other cases, it presents the actual content of the <code>href</code> attribute.</p>
<p>With Firefox Voiceover incorrectly notes the presence of the first <code>area</code> element as representing a link.</p>

<h3>Mac OS 10.10, visually</h3>
<p>Neither Yandex.browser 16.2, Safari 9.03 nor Firefox 44 present the information in the <code>alt</code> attribute. Using either mouse or keyboard navigation, Yandex.browser and Firefox present the absolute URL that is the link's destination as a status popup.</p> 

<p>Again, Firefox puts the unlinked area into the tab order as if it were a link.</p>

<p>On mouseover, but not when using keyboard navigation, Yandex.browser, Safari and Firefox all present the content of the <code>title</code> attribute as a popup over the relevant part of the image.</p>
