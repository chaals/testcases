 <h1><code>area</code> with <code>alt</code></h1>

 <p>The following image uses an imagemap that contains 5 <code>area</code> elements. The first has no href, and is used to provide an outline shape, the others have respectively a valid <code>alt</code> attribute; blank <code>alt</code> attribute; valid <code>alt</code> attribute and a descriptive <code>title</code> attribute; missing <code>alt</code> attribute.</p>

 <p> <img src="shapes.png" usemap="#theMap" alt="Four shapes are each links">
  <map name="theMap">
  <area shape=rect coords="50,50,100,100"> <!-- the hole in the red box -->
  <area shape=rect coords="25,25,125,125" href="45796.html" alt="One">
  <area shape=circle coords="200,75,50" href="45679.html" alt="">
  <area shape=poly coords="325,25,262,125,388,125" href="45679.html" alt="Two" title="link to two">
  <area shape=poly coords="450,25,435,60,400,75,435,90,450,125,465,90,500,75,465,60"
        href="45796.html">
  </map></p> 
  <p>To pass, the user must be able to determine the target of each link</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>On Mac OS 10.10, using VoiceOver</h3>
<p>Yandex.browser 16.2 (chromium-based), Safari 9.03 and Firefox 44 all fail to match the links with blank alt to those with valid alt, and instead VoiceOver presents the target of the link. In the case of the missing <code>alt</code> attribute with Firefox Voiceover presents the absolute URL of the link - in all other cases, it presents the actual content of the <code>href</code> attribute.</p>
<p>With Firefox Voiceover incorrectly notes the presence of the first <code>area</code> element as representing a link.</p>

<h3>Mac OS 10.10, visually</h3>
<p>Neither Yandex.browser 16.2, Safari 9.03 nor Firefox 44 present the information in the <code>alt</code> attribute. Using either mouse or keyboard navigation, Yandex.browser and Firefox present the absolute URL that is the link's destination as a status popup.</p> 

<p>Again, Firefox puts the unlinked area into the tab order as if it were a link.</p>

<p>On mouseover, but not when using keyboard navigation, Yandex.browser, Safari and Firefox all present the content of the <code>title</code> attribute as a popup over the relevant part of the image.</p>

<h3>Windows 11, JAWS 17 Beta</h3>
<p>IE 11 behaves as described for Yandex and Safari above.</p>
<p>Firefox 44 using the arrow keys for navigation gives the sequence "Image map link rect, Image map link One, Image map link circle, Image map link two, Image map link http://chaals.github.io/testcases...". When using the tab key instead it gives "Rect image map, one image map, Circle image map, two image map poly, Poly image map".</p>

<h3>Windows 10, NVDA2016.1:</h3>
 
<p>NVDA seems to require focus mode to be enabled in order to interact with an
imagemap. Focus mode is not enabled automatically when using the up/down
cursor keys, only when using the tab key to navigate content.
 
<p>FF44:
 
When using up.down cursor keys to navigate, NVDA announces "Graphic four
shapes are each links four shapes are each links".
 
When tabbing forward through the content, NVDA announces "Link rect", "One
link rect", "Link circle", "Two link poly".
 
When (shift) tabbing backwards through the content, NVDA encounters a silent
tab stop immediately after "Link rect".</p>
 
<p>IE11:
 
When using up/down cursor keys to navigate, NVDA announces "Graphic four
shapes are each links link link one link link link two 2 link".
 
When tabbing forwards or backwards through the content, NVDA encounters a
number (possibly four) of silent tab stops.</p>
 
<h3> Windows 10 and Jaws 17 (latest public patch):</h3>
 
<p>FF44:
 
Jaws has mishandled imagemaps in Firefox for some time. It announces each
area of the map as a static graphic, then again as an interactive link.</p>
 
<p>When using the up/down cursor keys to navigate, Jaws announces "Graphic Four
shapes are each links", "Graphic rect", "Graphic One", "Graphic circle",
"Graphic Two", "Graphic http://chaals.github.io/testcases/45796.html",
"Image Map Link rect", "Image Map Link One", "Image Map Link circle", "Image
Map Link Two", "Image Map Link
http://chaals.github.io/testcases/45796.html".</p>
 
<p>When tabbing forwards through the content, Jaws announces "Four shapes are
each links Graphic", "rect image map", "One image map", "circle Image Map
Link Graphic", "Two Image Map Link Graphic", "poly", "poly Image Map".</p>
 
<h4>IE11:</h4>
 
<p>When using up/down cursor keys to navigate, Jaws announces "Graphic Four
shapes are each links", "Image Map Link 36", "Image Map Link One", "Image
Map Link testcases/45679", "Image Map Link Two", "Image Map Link
testcases/45796".</p>
 
<p>When tabbing forwards through the content, Jaws announces "One Image Map
Link", "testcases/45679 Image Map Link", "Two Image Map Link", "link to
two", "testcases/45796 Image Map Link".</p>
 
<h2>Windows 10 and Narrator:</h2>
 
<p>Narrator does not use the tab key for navigation (it uses the caps lock key
as modifier, with the up/down/left/right cursor keys).</p>
 
<p>Edge:
 
When using the modifier and left/right cursor keys to navigate, Narrator
announces "Four shapes are each links graphic", "Link", "One link", "Link to
two", "Link".</p>
