 <h1>CSS as flow content test</h1>

 <p>This tests whether an HTML document providing CSS in a style element as flow content can be used as a style sheet.</p>

 <p>If the text is green, and each paragraph is surrounded by a dotted green border, the browser does use the linked HTML flow content as a style sheet - but in practice Firefox, Safari, and Yandex browser ignore the first rule in the linked stylesheet - I have to check if that's a bug or some counterintuitive specified behaviour.</p>

<style>
/* If this inline stylesheet is rendered, and applied, then style as flow content works too */

  style {color: blue}
  h1 { border: 3px dashed gold }
  style {display: block; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;}
</style>
