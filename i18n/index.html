<h1>Chaals' Random test stuff - i18n</h1>
  <p>There is <a href="https://chaals.github.io/testcases/i18n/%CF%80%CE%B1%CE%B8.html">https://chaals.github.io/testcases/i18n/%CF%80%CE%B1%CE%B8.html</a>
  which is of course painful to read. But with the link written as <a href="https://chaals.github.io/testcases/i18n/παθ.html">https://chaals.github.io/testcases/i18n/παθ.html</a> it still might work...</p>
