 <h1>SVG <code>title</code> as first child</h1>

 <p>This tests whether the SVG <code>title</code> element that is the first child, or last child, is the one that is used in practice.</p>

 <p>To run the test you need to get the title of the following SVG, e.g. by hovering and waiting for a tooltip to appear - if it is about "test of titleâ€¦" then the test passes, if it is "The implementation doesn't match" then the test shows the implementation doesn't match the HTML 5.1 specification</p>
