 <h1><code>style scoped</code> test</h1>

 <p>The following test is to see if there is support for <code>style scoped</code></p>

 <article>
  <h1>Style Scoped</h1>
  <p>The scoped attribute for the style element will eventually allow for you to include style elements mid-document. To do this, you must mark up your style element with the scoped attribute.</p>
  <section>
    <style scoped>
      p { color: red; }
      P::after { content: "You get a suffix"} 
    </style>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas.</p>
  </section>
  <p>If only the preceeding paragraph is red and the last words are "You get a suffix", the attribute is supported.</p> 
<p>If more paragraphs are red, and finish with the text "You get a suffix" the attribute is unsupported.</p>
</article>

<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>On Max OS 10.10</h3>
<p>With browser Yandex 16.3 and Opera 36.0 (blink-based) and Safari 9.1 (webkit-based) the attribute is unsupported</p>
<p>Firefox 45 supports the attribute.</p>
